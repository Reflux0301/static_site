        <p>Thank you for your patience during downtime!</p>
        <p>To keep it brief, we&#39;ve shifted from Proxmox to Windows Hyper-V full time using Fedora CoreOS images.</p>
        <p>This has a lot of benefits: better maintainability, ability to provide a slightly reproducible infrastructure (which you can view), better security (up to date Windows with hardened policies instead of a Debian based environment), scalability, easier disaster recovery.
        <p>As mentioned, we have cut off support for ABS (Anonymous Browsing Sessions) as it is undergoing a massive
            refactor,
            with the goal of moving away from a VPN but routing all traffic through Tor.</p>
        <p>I2P is going to be harder to maintain, we&#39;ve moved to I2PD however it will require manual intervention
            for
            restarting/reloading the configuration.</p>
        <p>Other than that, downtime has been smooth sailing.</p>
